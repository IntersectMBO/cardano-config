# Revision history for cardano-config

## 1.1.0.0 -- 2026-09-08

Schema format version stays at `1`: the `v1` tag had not been cut when
`1.0.0.0` was released, so the constraint changes below are absorbed into it.
This is the last release that can do that — once `v1` is tagged, a change to
what validates needs a new format version.

### Breaking changes

* `NodeConfiguration` gains a `genesisInjectionRoot` field (the directory the
  ledger resolves genesis injection files against). The constructor is exported,
  so code building the record has to account for it (#17).
* The `LedgerDB` `Backend` key is now either the string `"V2InMemory"` or the
  tagged object `{ "LSM": { "DatabasePath": …, "ExportPath": … } }`. The flat
  spelling — `Backend: "V2LSM"` alongside `LSMDatabasePath`/`LSMExportPath` — is
  still accepted by the parser (`migrate` folds it into the tagged form, raising
  `MigratedToCurrentFormat`), but no longer validates against the schema (#14).
* `LedgerDbBackendSelector` now has its own `HasCodec` instance, and derives
  `Eq` (#14).
* The JSON under `defaults/` is compiled into the library with `file-embed`
  rather than installed as `data-files`. The `data-files` stanza is gone, so the
  defaults are no longer reachable through the Cabal data directory at run time;
  a distributed binary no longer needs one (#15).

### Added

* Genesis initial-data injection: a test network's genesis can name its initial
  funds, stake pools, stake credentials, delegations and DReps under the genesis
  `extraConfig` key, for `cardano-ledger` to stream from separate JSON files.
  New module `Cardano.Configuration.Genesis.Injection`, and from
  `Cardano.Configuration`: `nodeConfigurationInjectionFS`,
  `nodeConfigurationInjections`, `InjectionSlot (..)`, `InjectionSource (..)`,
  `injectionHasFS` and `injectionMountPoint`.

  Three conditions the ledger would otherwise report much later, while building
  the initial ledger state, are now checked as the configuration is read: a
  field takes its data from the legacy form or from `extraConfig`, never both;
  injection is rejected on a mainnet genesis; and a referenced injection file
  must exist. File hashes are left to the ledger, which verifies them as it
  streams (#17).
* `MaybeHashed (..)` is re-exported from `Cardano.Configuration` (#14).
* `Cardano.Configuration.Embedded`, exposing the embedded `defaults/`, and
  `decodeValueBytes` in `Cardano.Configuration.File.Merge` for decoding them
  (#15).
* `migrate` handles more legacy spellings: the flat `LedgerDB` snapshot options
  (`SnapshotInterval`, `NumOfDiskSnapshots`, …) are nested under
  `LedgerDB.Snapshots`, the flat `V2LSM` backend keys are folded into the tagged
  `Backend` form, and a top-level `ApplicationName` is collapsed into
  `HermodTracing.TraceOptionNodeName`. The obsolete `ApplicationVersion` and
  `EnableP2P` keys are now dropped rather than carried forward as
  unrecognised-key warnings (#14).

### Changed

* The `TxSubmissionInitDelay` default is now 60 seconds, was 0 (#14).
