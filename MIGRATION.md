# Migrating a configuration

`cardano-config migrate` brings an older `cardano-node` configuration up to
the current format. It reads `-` as standard input, so you can fetch and
convert in one step:

```console
$ cardano-config migrate old-config.json > config.json
$ curl -sL <url-of-old-config> | cardano-config migrate - > config.json
```

The parser runs the same steps in memory on every file it reads, so an older
file still loads. It warns you when it has to. Run `migrate` to make the file
on disk match what the parser sees, and to stop the warnings.

This page lists every change `migrate` makes, so that you can audit the result
key by key. The lists come from
[`Cardano.Configuration.File.Migrate`](src/Cardano/Configuration/File/Migrate.hs).

## What it does not do

`migrate` changes the shape of the document and the spelling of its keys.
It keeps the values as you wrote them. It does not:

- fill in any default
- read, hash or validate a genesis file
- read any other file the configuration names
- reject a value that the parser will later reject

Run `cardano-config resolve --config <file>` afterwards to make sure that the
result parses.

## When it refuses

`migrate` refuses two documents outright:

| Document | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| One at a format version newer than this program writes | Migration never goes backwards. Upgrade `cardano-config` instead. |
| One whose sections name other files | Reading those files is what `migrate` does not do. Copy each file's contents in under its section key first. |

## The envelope

`migrate` puts the document in the envelope, and writes these top-level keys:

| Key | What it writes |
|-----|----------------|
| `$schema` | The URL of the current schema. It keeps the one you pinned when your document is already at the current version. |
| `Version` | The current format version. It keeps a version newer than that one. |
| `MinNodeVersion` | Yours, carried through. It never invents one. |
| `Configuration` | The configuration itself, with every component under its section key. |

A key that sits next to `Configuration` rather than inside it moves inside. If
the same key sits in both places, the one inside `Configuration` wins, and
`migrate` raises an `EnvelopeKeyCollision` warning.

## Renamed keys

`migrate` rewrites these names. The parser rejects the old ones.

| Old name | Current name |
|----------|--------------|
| `EnableRpc` | `EnableGrpc` |
| `RpcSocketPath` | `GrpcSocketPath` |
| `RpcListenAddress` | `GrpcListenAddress` |
| `RpcListenPort` | `GrpcListenPort` |
| `RpcTlsCertificateFile` | `GrpcTlsCertificateFile` |
| `RpcTlsPrivateKeyFile` | `GrpcTlsPrivateKeyFile` |
| `RpcTlsChainCertificateFiles` | `GrpcTlsChainCertificateFiles` |
| `TargetNumberOfRootPeers` | `DeadlineTargetNumberOfRootPeers` |
| `TargetNumberOfKnownPeers` | `DeadlineTargetNumberOfKnownPeers` |
| `TargetNumberOfEstablishedPeers` | `DeadlineTargetNumberOfEstablishedPeers` |
| `TargetNumberOfActivePeers` | `DeadlineTargetNumberOfActivePeers` |
| `TargetNumberOfKnownBigLedgerPeers` | `DeadlineTargetNumberOfKnownBigLedgerPeers` |
| `TargetNumberOfEstablishedBigLedgerPeers` | `DeadlineTargetNumberOfEstablishedBigLedgerPeers` |
| `TargetNumberOfActiveBigLedgerPeers` | `DeadlineTargetNumberOfActiveBigLedgerPeers` |

These three are renamed only inside an `AcceptedConnectionsLimit` object,
because the names are too common to rewrite anywhere else:

| Old name | Current name |
|----------|--------------|
| `hardLimit` | `HardLimit` |
| `softLimit` | `SoftLimit` |
| `delay` | `Delay` |

If both the old and the current name are present at the same level, the
current name wins, and `migrate` raises a `RenamedKeyCollision` warning.
Reconcile the two by hand when the dropped value was the one you wanted.

## Dropped keys

`migrate` removes these. Nothing reads them now.

| Key | Why |
|-----|-----|
| `PBftSignatureThreshold` | Comes from consensus defaults. |
| `LastKnownBlockVersion-Major` | Comes from consensus defaults. |
| `LastKnownBlockVersion-Minor` | Comes from consensus defaults. |
| `LastKnownBlockVersion-Alt` | Comes from consensus defaults. |
| `ApplicationVersion` | The Byron software version number, now fixed in code. |
| `EnableP2P` | P2P is the only mode. |
| `Protocol` | The protocol selector no longer selects anything. |
| `MaxKnownMajorProtocolVersion` | The node never read it. |

These belonged to the old logging system, which `trace-dispatcher` replaced.
`migrate` drops them from the top level only, because the names are too common
to remove at any depth:

`UseTraceDispatcher`, `TurnOnLogging`, `TurnOnLogMetrics`, `defaultBackends`,
`defaultScribes`, `setupBackends`, `setupScribes`, `minSeverity`, `options`.

## Regrouped keys

Older files wrote many keys flat, at the top level. `migrate` moves each one
under the section that owns it. For example `ConsensusMode` moves under
`ConsensusConfig`, and `LedgerDB` moves under `StorageConfig`.

Three groups change shape as well as place.

### Snapshot options

These keys sat directly under `LedgerDB`. They move into a nested `Snapshots`
object:

`SnapshotInterval`, `SlotOffset`, `RateLimit`, `MinDelay`, `MaxDelay`,
`NumOfDiskSnapshots`.

If a `Snapshots` key is already present, it wins, and the flat keys are
dropped. `Snapshots` can be the string `"Mithril"`, which is a policy rather
than a set of values, so merging the two makes no sense.

### The LSM backend

`Backend: "V2LSM"`, with its optional `LSMDatabasePath` and `LSMExportPath`,
becomes the tagged form:

```json
"Backend": { "LSM": { "DatabasePath": "lsm", "ExportPath": "lsm-export" } }
```

`Backend: "V2InMemory"` stays as it is.

### Tracing

These keys move, unchanged, into an inline `HermodTracing` object:

`TraceOptions`, `TraceOptionForwarder`, `TraceOptionNodeName`,
`TraceOptionMetricsPrefix`, `TraceOptionResourceFrequency`,
`TraceOptionLedgerMetricsFrequency`, `TracePrometheusSimpleRun`.

`migrate` keeps their flat spelling rather than the inner one.
`TraceOptionResourceFrequency` and `TraceOptionLedgerMetricsFrequency` have no
inner counterpart, so a rename loses them.

A top-level `ApplicationName` becomes `HermodTracing.TraceOptionNodeName`. It
named the Byron software version, which nothing reads now, so the tracing node
name takes it over.

## Keys it does not recognize

`migrate` keeps a key that no parser claims, such as a typo, so that you lose
nothing. That key stays unrecognized, so the parser raises an
`UnrecognisedKeys` warning on the next read. Remove it by hand for a
configuration that reads without warnings.
